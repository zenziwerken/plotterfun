# Plotterfun

I came across Pltterfun 'cause I built a [Universal Pen Holder](https://www.zenziwerken.de/Nachbauen/Universal-Pen-Holder) for my CNC-Machine (called Zenzi). After some experiments with Half-toning I made some [other graphics](https://www.zenziwerken.de/Plottgrafiken) that can be made with a plotter. At the moment the descriptions are German, but I about to translate them to English a.s.a.p.

Fork from https://github.com/mitxela/plotterfun with a few changes and a new algorithm:
* Crosshatching [NEW]
* Halftone [ADD: Options spirals]
* Subline [ADD: vertical option, reduced pointcount, removed unnescessairy double lines]

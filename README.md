# Plotterfun

I came across Pltterfun 'cause I built a [Universal Pen Holder](https://www.zenziwerken.de/Nachbauen/Universal-Pen-Holder) for my CNC-Machine (called Zenzi). After some experiments with Half-toning I made some [other grafics](https://www.zenziwerken.de/Plottgrafiken) that can be made with a plotter. At the moment the discriptios are German, but I about to translate them to English a.s.a.p.

Fork from https://github.com/mitxela/plotterfun with a few changes and a new algorithm:
* Halftone with Spirals [Improved]
* Crosshatching [NEW]
